Hello TEAM-1!!!

This task is to develop your git skills and project organisation. You will run into conflicts when merging your branches and you will need to work together to solve them.

--------------------------------------

Your job is to complete the create.html page. This page will explain how to create a git project and link it to a github repository.

The page itself has been created in the /html directory, but it is empty! You'll have to create any additional directories and files you need - css, images, etc.


The page layout, design, colours and style are entirely up to you. The tasks tell you what you have to complete, how you do it is your choice.

--------------------------------------

You MUST only work inside the team-1 branch. 

Each team member MUST complete at least one of the following tasks.

Each task MUST be completed in a separate branch that is created from the team-1 branch.

Name your branches team-1-task-1 or something similar.

Complete your work, then merge your task branch into the team branch. 

When all tasks are complete ALL changes should be inside your team branch.

--------------------------------------

Your tasks are:

Task 1) 

Add a header with page title and a navigation bar.
The navigation bar MUST link to the following pages - you MUST NOT create the pages, just add links. They will not lead anywhere until every team has completed their tasks.

The navigation bar must have the following items:

    "Create" - link to './create.html':

    "Branching" - link yo './branch.html';

    "Add Changes" - link to './add.html';

    "Review Changes" - link to './review.html';

    "Merge" - link to './merge.html'

    "Stash" - link to './stash.html'

Task 2)

Add a area on the page detailing the 'git init' command. Explain how to use it.

Task 3)

Add an area to the page explaining how to create a github repository. Screenshots are probably a good idea.

Task 4)

Add an area on the page showing how to use the git remote add origin command. Screenshots are probably a good idea.

Task 5)

Add an area explaining how to create a main branch and how to push your changes to the repo.

Task 6)

Add an area explaining how to clone an existing repository from github

--------------------------------------

This guide will be for your use - please add content in your own words, but cut and paste if you have to. Github docs should have good explanations for the commands, sites like https://git-scm.com/ will have very detailed explanations. Use any resource you want.

You should only need a paragraph or two for most tasks. A user should be able to use this a quick reference, not a detailed description of how git works. Think about what YOU need to know at this level - thats what I want to see.
