            <h3>Explaning the merge flow</h3>
            <p>
                The merge flow is a complicated process, maybe not as complicated as we think. 
                You have a main branch for the work and create new branches from that. When you have finished your 
                work and want to merge your work to the main branch you initiate the merge command.
