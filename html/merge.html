            <h3>Explaning the merge flow</h3>
            <p>
                The merge flow is a complicated process, maybe not as complicated as we think.
                You have a main branch for the work and create new branches from that. When you have finished your
                work and want to merge your work to the main branch you initiate the merge command which has several steps.
                This guide explanes how you merge a second branch to the main one.
            </p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Checkout the main branch and pull (beacuse you should ALWAYS pull)</li>
                <li>If you experience conflicts, checkout the note in the end of the text otherwise go to the next step</li>
                <li>Write the merge command followed by the branch you want to merge from</li>
                <li>You finalize the merge by adding, commiting and pushing the changes</li>
                <li>Now you have officially merged to branches!!</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                NOTE!
                <br>
                If you experience conflicts during your merge into the main branch, you should ALWAYS abort. This
                is because you should NEVER handle conflicts in the main branch. To merge when encountering conflicts you use the samecommands but
                you checkout the branch where you did the changes, that is to say you go to the second branch and merge the
                main into the second branch then handle the conflicts. After the conlflicts are handeled, you checkout the main branch and initiate the merge
                process once again to merge the second branch into the main one. This is to say you have to do an extra step to merge when encutering conflicts.

            <p>
                Something to be aware when you do the merge is always to do it from the 
                main to the branch, in that way you will always be secure that if any conflict 
                happens is going to be in the branch.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you have done the merge it can show some conflic in the code, in that case 
                you should check manually which code you want to keep and to remove everything else.
                Making sure all the code from up to down is clean. When all has been checked then you 
                can add, commit and push the task.

            <h3>How to add, commit and push a merged branch to the repository</h3>
            <p>
                When you perform a merge, you effectively merge one branch into another—typically a feature branch or bug fix
                branch into a main branch such as master or develop.
                Not only will the code changes get merged in, but also all the commits that went into the feature branch
            </p> 
            <ol>
                <li>Stash your local working branch changes. Checkout to your local branch</li>
                <li>Update your local main branch with remote. Checkout to the main branch </li>
                <li>Merge local working branch with main branch.</li>
                <li>Get your stash changes and push your working branch.</li>
                NOTE! git merge merges the specified branch into the currently active branch.
            </ol>

        <div class="merge-git-abort">
            <h3>'git merge --abort'</h3>
            <p>
                The “git merge --abort” operation essentially terminates the merger that you have just carried out and 
                separated the two versions of your file,i.e., the current version and the older version.
                <br>
                NOTE! Use git-reset or git merge --abort to cancel a merge that had conflicts. Please note that all the changes will be reset, 
                and this operation cannot be reverted, so make sure to commit or git-stash all your changes before you start a merge.
