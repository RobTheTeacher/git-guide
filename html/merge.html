            <h3>Explaning the merge flow</h3>
            <p>
                The merge flow is a complicated process, maybe not as complicated as we think. 
                You have a main branch for the work and create new branches from that. When you have finished your 
                work and want to merge your work to the main branch you initiate the merge command which has several steps. 
                This guide explanes how you merge a second branch to the main one. 
            </p>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Checkout the main branch and pull (beacuse you should ALWAYS pull)</li>
                <li>If you experience conlflicts, checkout the note in the end of the text otherwise go to the next step</li>
                <li>Write the merge command followed by the branch you want to merge from</li>
                <li>You finalize the merge by adding, commiting and pushing the changes</li>
                <li>Now you have officially merged to branches!!</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
            NOTE!<br>If you experience conflicts during your merge into the main branch, you should ALWAYS abort. This is because 
            you should NEVER handle conflicts in the main branch. To merge when encountering conflicts you use the same commands but 
            you checkout the branch where you did the changes, that is to say you go to the second branch and merge the main into the second branch then
            handle the conflicts. After the conlflicts are handeled, you checkout the main branch and initiate the merge process once again to merge the second branch 
            into the main one. This is to say you have to do an extra step to merge when encutering conflicts.
