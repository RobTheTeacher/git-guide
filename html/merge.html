        <h3>Explaning the merge flow</h3>
        <p>
            The merge flow is a complicated process, maybe not as complicated as we think.
            You have a main branch for the work and create new branches from that. When you have finished your
            work and want to merge your work to the main branch you initiate the merge command which has several steps.
            This guide explanes how you merge a second branch to the main one.
        </p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Checkout the main branch and pull (beacuse you should ALWAYS pull)</li>
            <li>If you experience conlflicts, checkout the note in the end of the text otherwise go to the next step
            </li>
            <li>Write the merge command followed by the branch you want to merge from</li>
            <li>You finalize the merge by adding, commiting and pushing the changes</li>
            <li>Now you have officially merged to branches!!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            NOTE!<br>If you experience conflicts during your merge into the main branch, you should ALWAYS abort. This
            is because
            you should NEVER handle conflicts in the main branch. To merge when encountering conflicts you use the same
            commands but
            you checkout the branch where you did the changes, that is to say you go to the second branch and merge the
            main into the second branch then
            handle the conflicts. After the conlflicts are handeled, you checkout the main branch and initiate the merge
            process once again to merge the second branch
            into the main one. This is to say you have to do an extra step to merge when encutering conflicts.

        <h3>How to add, commit and push a merged branch to the repository</h3>

        <p>When you perform a merge, you effectively merge one branch into anotherâ€”typically a feature branch or bug fix branch into a main branch such as master or develop. 
            Not only will the code changes get merged in, but also all the commits that went into the feature branch</p>
            
            <ol>
                <li>Stash your local working branch changes. Checkout to your local branch</li>
                <li>Update your local main branch with remote. Checkout to the main branch </li>
                <li>Merge local working branch with main branch.</li>
                <li>Get your stash changes and push your working branch.</li>
                Note: git merge merges the specified branch into the currently active branch.
