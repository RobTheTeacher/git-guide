Hello TEAM-4!!!

This task is to develop your git skills and project organisation. You will run into conflicts when merging your branches and you will need to work together to solve them.

--------------------------------------

Your job is to complete the review.html page. This page will explain how to review changes to a git project before pushing.

The page itself has been created in the /html directory, but it is empty! You'll have to create any additional directories and files you need - css, images, etc.


The page layout, design, colours and style are entirely up to you. The tasks tell you what you have to complete, how you do it is your choice.

--------------------------------------

You MUST only work inside the team-4 branch. 

Each team member MUST complete at least one of the following tasks.

Each task MUST be completed in a separate branch that is created from the team-4 branch.

Name your branches team-4-task-1 or something similar.

Complete your work, then merge your task branch into the team branch. 

When all tasks are complete ALL changes should be inside your team branch.

--------------------------------------

Your tasks are:

Task 1) 

Add a header with page title and a navigation bar.
The navigation bar MUST link to the following pages - you MUST NOT create the pages, just add links. They will not lead anywhere until every team has completed their tasks.

The navigation bar must have the following items:

    "Create" - link to './create.html':

    "Branching" - link yo './branch.html';

    "Add Changes" - link to './add.html';

    "Review Changes" - link to './review.html';

    "Merge" - link to './merge.html'

    "Stash" - link to './stash.html'

Task 2)

Add a area on the page detailing the 'git status' command. Explain how to use it and what it shows

Task 3)

Add an area to the page detailing the 'git diff' command. Explain how to show individual files or alll files

Task 4)

Add an area on the page detailing the 'git pull' command. Explain why it is so important

Task 5)
q
Add an area explaining the 'git log' command

--------------------------------------

This guide will be for your use - please add content in your own words, but cut and paste if you have to. Github docs should have good explanations for the commands, sites like https://git-scm.com/ will have very detailed explanations. Use any resource you want.

You should only need a paragraph or two for most tasks. A user should be able to use this a quick reference, not a detailed description of how git works. Think about what YOU need to know at this level - thats what I want to see.
