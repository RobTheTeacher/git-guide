    <h2>Git Pull</h2>
    <code>git pull [<options>] [<repository> [<refspec>…​]]</code>
    <p>Updates local with the latest changes from a remote repository into the current branch. It's very important for version control to keep up with the changes and working on the latest updates. 
    </p>
    <p><code><repository></code> should be the name of a remote repository. <code><refspec></code> can name an arbitrary remote ref (for example, the name of a tag) or even a collection of refs with corresponding remote-tracking branches (e.g., refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*), but usually it is the name of a branch in the remote repository.</p>
