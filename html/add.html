<h2>Git add command</h2>

<p>The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. It tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit. However, git add doesn't really affect the repository in any significant wayâ€”changes are not actually recorded until you run git commit .</p>
